# Blender Donut Project

This is my first Blender project, created by following the Blender Guru tutorial on YouTube. The project focuses on learning the basics of Blender, including modelling, shading, lighting, and rendering.

### Project Overview
This project includes:
- **Modelling**: The donut and plate.
- **Shading**: Texturing and material setup for realistic effects.
- **Lighting**: Setting up a light source to enhance the realism.
- **Rendering**: Final rendered animation and image.

### File Structure
- `Donut.blend`: The base Blender file for the project.
- `Donut_Rendered.blend`: The file containing the final render settings.
- `Rendered/`: The folder containing the final render outputs (images and animations).

### Notes
This project was created as a learning exercise. It showcases my journey in 3D design and rendering using Blender.
